# Exercise 1 - Numerical Integration #

## Compilation ##

- To compile, simply type
```bash
$ make
```
and
```bash
./main
```
as `main` is the main executable.

- And, to clean the secondary files (binaries, objects, ...) type
```bash
$ make clean
```

## Input ##

The input can be modified in the file `data/input.data`. **Note**: don't alter
the order of the lines, just change the value of the data.

Once the program is compiled, you can change the input data and type `./main`
again. There's no need to recompile.

## Output ##

The output can be printed to the screen, to an output file or both. The output
file can be found as `data/output.data`.
